I mostly work on this project using Qt Creator, and if you use it to build binaries, everything
should work fine.

The qmake/make/make install trio is currently being worked on, so I don't advice using it to
install stuff. But if you really want to, this project relies on the presence of the following
development packages :
-libc
-qmake
-QtCore
-QtGui (also called qt-x11 in some repositories)
